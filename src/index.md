## How I approach the Product Design Process

Product design is an iterative journey that combines the final form of a product with the strategic choices made throughout its development. It's a dynamic process that requires the designer to be present, adaptable, and responsive to the context and evolving needs.

### Gaining Perspective and Defining Priorities
The first step is immersing myself in the domain where the product exists. By understanding the industry landscape, target audience, and business goals, I start gaining valuable perspective. As priorities emerge, a clear problem statement is declared, guiding the direction of the design process.

### Decomposing and Analyzing
Next, I break down the overarching problem into smaller functional problems. This decomposition allows for a deeper analysis of how these individual problems interact and influence the overall solution. By studying the interdependencies, I can identify appropriate solution options, moving from the holistic view to the intricate details.

### Fueling Optionality and Intent
From the range of solution options, different product possibilities emerge. These options provide a breadth of choices, fostering optionality. Each option represents a unique set of solutions, ensuring that diverse approaches are explored. This variety fuels creativity and allows for intentional decision-making, leading to better outcomes.

### Aligning with Business Goals
With clear goals and a comprehensive understanding of the available options, I collaborate closely with stakeholders and decision-makers. Together, we evaluate and select the product option that best aligns with the business purpose. This selection involves making informed judgments about how the product will resonate with the market, ultimately driving its success.

### Being Present and Adapting
Throughout the process, the designer's presence is crucial. It's essential to be fully engaged, actively listening to insights from users, stakeholders, and the market. This presence allows for timely adjustments, as the designer makes judgment calls on where to channel their energy and resources, ensuring the design remains aligned with the evolving needs and context.

By embracing the non-linear nature of the product design process and being present in every step, I aim to create meaningful and impactful solutions that truly address the needs and goals of businesses and their users.
