# Social Media Tools for Inbound Marketing

As a product designer at a B2B Inbound Marketing Platform Startup, I was part of a product team dedicated to improving our offerings with the goal of increasing customer success in attracting new traffic and leads through social media tactics. We recognized the challenges we faced, including lower-than-expected adoption and retention rates, as well as users struggling to fully leverage the value of our social media marketing tools. To address these issues, we embarked on a mission to enhance the usability and effectiveness of our tools, enabling our users to achieve better results in their social media endeavors.

## Unveiling User Insights

To gain a deep understanding of user behavior, motivations, and pain points, we conducted extensive research. Our exploration revealed several issues, for the sake of brevity, I will highlight: usability concerns, reliance on spreadsheets for planning, and difficulty in establishing a connection between social media tactics and lead generation. With these insights in mind, we embraced autonomy and experimentation to pave the way for improvements.

## Streamlining the Social Organic Channel

Our initial focus was on refining the Social Media Post Editor to address unexpected surprises users encountered when viewing their published content. By introducing a post preview feature and implementing other usability enhancements, we transformed the tool into a powerful asset that allowed users to effortlessly create captivating posts across various social media platforms.

We proceeded with the development of a Social Media Calendar, an intuitive tool that streamlined the planning and scheduling of social media content, ensuring our users maintain a consistent online presence. Additionally, we provided content suggestions, highlighting significant Brazilian holidays and professional commemorative dates.

## Unlocking the Potential of Lead Generation

Recognizing that lead generation was the core value proposition of our platform, we developed a feature that enabled users to track leads originating from links shared on social channels. By measuring the direct impact of social media tactics on lead generation, we provided unique value and solidified the alignment between our social media tools and the platform's primary objective.

## Venturing into the Social Paid Channel

As our product evolved, we saw an opportunity to explore new offerings and expand into the realm of Paid Media. This presented us with unique challenges and exciting possibilities. As usual, our target audience demanded user-friendly tools that required minimal training.

We probed the problem space by integrating Facebook Lead Ads seamlessly, instantly populating our users' lead databases with leads generated through this powerful feature. The success we observed within the cohort of users who activated the new integration surpassed other conversion methods, validating the value of paid media integration.

Building upon this momentum, we introduced the Facebook Ads Editor, simplifying the creation and publishing process of Facebook ads. This simple and powerful tool empowered SMB Digital Marketers to effortlessly reach custom audiences and optimize their ad campaigns for maximum impact.

## Learning product teams drive successful outcomes

Throughout my time at the company, our dedication to customer-centric design, data-driven insights, and iterative development proved pivotal to our success. By providing intuitive and powerful social media marketing tools, we enhanced the ability of SMB digital marketers to engage their audience and generate valuable leads.
