      <h1>Navigation Design for a SEO Optimized Website</h1>
<p>As a Senior UX Designer at a demand generation startup, I took on the challenge of redesigning a high-traffic SEO optimized website that focused on Brazilian telecom services. Previous research findings showed the existing navigation lacked consistency and failed to convey a clear value proposition to users.</p>
<p>Working alongside a Junior UI Designer, we formed a collaborative team involving product management, engineering, SEO, and content teams. Our shared goal was to redefine the website's information architecture and implement a user-centric design.</p>
<h2>Previous Research</h2>
<p>TODO [Talk a little about the project before my arrival]</p>
<h2>Creating a New Structure</h2>
<p>We utilized the findings from our research to create a site map and wireframes that defined core interaction concepts. These wireframes served as the foundation for the UI Designer to develop new UI components. Regular mockups were shared with the product team and key stakeholders to ensure alignment with organizational goals.</p>
<p>To mitigate risks associated with ranking drops and ensure optimized navigation for both users and search engines, we closely collaborated with SEO Analysts and Content Designers. Together, we mapped the content inventory and designed the information architecture.</p>
<h2>Validating the Design</h2>
<p>User testing played a crucial role in validating our design decisions. By conducting user tests, we gained valuable insights into how users interacted with the new navigation structure. These insights enabled us to reprioritize UI feature bets and further enhance the user understanding of the website's value proposition.</p>
<h2>Successful Delivery and Performance</h2>
<p>We successfully delivered the redesigned navigation structure within the business quarter. Throughout the process, we closely monitored metrics such as user engagement and bounce rates. The redesigned navigation improved task success and increased user engagement while maintaining high SEO performance, which was vital for the website's profitability.</p>
