      <h1>Social Media Tools for Inbound Marketing</h1>
<p>As a product designer at a B2B Inbound Marketing Platform Startup, I was an integral part of a dedicated product team aiming to enhance our offerings and increase customer success in attracting new traffic and leads through social media tactics. Throughout this case story, I will share my insights and experiences as we embarked on a mission to improve our social media marketing tools and achieve better results for our users.</p>
<h2>Unveiling Business and User Insights</h2>
<p>I had the privilege of working closely with a great Product Manager, who brought invaluable subject matter expertise, conducted thorough customer research, and provided a holistic business perspective. Collaborating hand in hand, we delved into product data.</p>
<p>As we searched for the best approach to organize and synthesize user needs, I discovered the power of user story mapping. This approach became our go-to method, enabling us to create shared knowledge and maintain a strong alignment between our solution and the user's journey.</p>
<p>To effectively organize and synthesize and create shared knowledge findings, I settled with user story mapping. This visual representation became a vital tool for sharing knowledge, ensuring that our solution remained closely aligned with the user's journey.</p>

<h2>Improving the current feature</h2>
<p>Our initial focus was on refining the Social Media Post Editor to address unexpected surprises users encountered when viewing their published content. By introducing a post preview feature and implementing other usability enhancements, we transformed the tool into a powerful asset that allowed users to effortlessly create captivating posts across various social media platforms.</p>

<p>We proceeded with the development of a Social Media Calendar, an intuitive tool that streamlined the planning and scheduling of social media content, ensuring our users maintain a consistent online presence. Additionally, we provided content suggestions, highlighting significant Brazilian holidays and professional commemorative dates.</p>

<h2>Unlocking the Potential of Lead Generation</h2>
<p>Recognizing that lead generation was the core value proposition of our platform, we developed a feature that enabled users to track leads originating from links shared on social channels. By measuring the direct impact of social media tactics on lead generation, we provided unique value and solidified the alignment between our social media tools and the platform's primary objective.</p>

Traditional Social Engagement indicators such as Likes and Comments were treated by some as vanity metrics. Providing conversion data appealed to marketers seeking sales-oriented indicators.

<h2>Venturing into the Social Paid Channel</h2>
<p>As our product evolved, we saw an opportunity to explore new offerings and expand into the realm of Paid Media. This presented us with unique challenges and exciting possibilities. As usual, our target audience demanded user-friendly tools that required minimal training.</p>
<p>We probed the problem space by integrating Facebook Lead Ads seamlessly, instantly populating our users' lead databases with leads generated through this powerful feature. The success we observed within the cohort of users who activated the new integration surpassed other conversion methods, validating the value of paid media integration.</p>
<p>Building upon this momentum, we introduced the Facebook Ads Editor, simplifying the creation and publishing process of Facebook ads. This simple and powerful tool empowered SMB Digital Marketers to effortlessly reach custom audiences and optimize their ad campaigns for maximum impact.</p>
<h2>Achieving Results through Iterative Development</h2>
<p>The journey of product development was anything but linear. It was characterized by moments of chaos as we explored different solutions. Embracing the principles of Kanban Software Development, we continually evolved our work processes. Balancing priorities and considering the broader perspective, we made tough decisions and let go of ideas that didn't align with our objectives.</p>
<p>With this experience I learned that an flexible and iterative approach leverages outcomes. I witnessed that adoption and retention rates of our social media features experienced a significant boost, with overall adoption going from approximately 8 to 30 percent of our platform's customer base. Living this experience made me aware of the potential of to customer-centric design, data-driven insights, and iterative development and I never took engaged the same way with very prescriptive, linear approaches to product design.</p>
