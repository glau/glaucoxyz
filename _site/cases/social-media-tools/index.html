      <h1>Social media solutions for Inbound Marketing</h1>
<p>As a product designer for a B2B Inbound Marketing Platform Startup, I was tasked with revamping the social media marketing tools for SMB Digital Marketers. The company's all-in-one inbound marketing platform had social media features, but adoption and retention rates were low, with users struggling to extract value from the tools provided. The company's target customer was not knowledgeable about digital marketing, and investing in high touch customer support was not sustainable in the long run.</p>
<p>To address this problem, we needed to design a solution that made it easy for users to achieve success with their social media marketing efforts. We conducted research and found that users were concerned about their content's appearance on social media cards and needed help planning and maintaining a content feed. Our aim was to create a product that nudged users in the right direction to execute social media marketing tactics that engaged their audience and generated traffic for high conversion landing pages.</p>
<p>Together with the Product Manager, we identified a set of problems, prioritized them, and created four product options: a Social Media Post Editor, a Social Media Calendar, Lead Generation Analytics, and a Facebook Ads Editor. Our main challenge was to reconcile the company's performance-oriented inbound marketing playbook, where lead generation was the primary goal, with the social media marketing capabilities of the product.</p>
<p>To address this challenge, we conducted extensive research to understand the problem domain, product usability, the user journey, and user needs and motivations. We designed prototypes to explore the solution space and clarify implementation details. Our design process involved constant iteration and testing, which helped us refine the product and ensure it met the users' needs.</p>
<p>The social media tools we created were successful in improving adoption and retention rates while providing unique value for users. The integration with Facebook Lead Ads campaigns was an immediate success, and the Facebook Ads Editor streamlined the campaign building capabilities, making it easier for customers to start publishing Facebook ads. Our product made it easy for users to plan, create, and publish social media content that engaged their audience and generated leads for their business.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our solution to the social media marketing tools problem was a success, thanks to our user-centric design approach, constant iteration, and testing. The product provided unique value to users, and the company's inbound marketing playbook was reconciled with the social media marketing capabilities of the product.</p>
